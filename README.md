Each folder is a step in the analysis.

It may contain a Conda environment, bash command file, and input/output data files needed to carry out that step of the analysis. Usually, you will need to copy/move the output from one folder to the next. 

The Illumina sequencing reads used as input in the first step are available for download from the NCBI SRA ([PRJNA914220](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA914220/)).
